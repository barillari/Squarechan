There was a period in 2010 or so when everyone was implementing a
mobile/social/photo-sharing app. This is mine.

It consists of a website, implemented in Python with Django, and an
Android app, implemented in Scala. It is chiefly of interest because
of the latter. Scala has some advantages for Java development, and
many drawbacks. 

The code that I've written is Affero GPL v3'd. There's a bunch of code
that other people have written; it is licensed according to the
licenses embedded in the files the code came in. All of those are
AGPLv3 compatible, as far as I know. If I have made any licensing
mistakes, please let me know and I will correct them posthaste.

Squarechan is still up as of this writing. It might be taken down at
any point, so don't rely on that. Also, it's not moderated very much,
so be careful. If you see anything bad, let me know and I'll take it
down.

This code is made available in the hopes that it will be useful. 

Cheers.
