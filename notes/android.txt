Welcome to Squarechan! 

Squarechan lets you connect with people near you.

You can read posts and see photos by people near you or post some of
your own. You can reveal as much or as little as you like about your
location in your posts.

{Get started} set the "have seen this" preference; FORWARD to M. 

   

M: Main page


if not "first time" set -> FORWARD to S

if not launched: start a timer; check location every 30m _as long as the activity is running_ (v 1.1: user-adjustible) (set a flag in onResume/onPause)

start a ScheduledExecutorService to run every 10 minutes. this service will:
      - if the loc is too old, find a new loc, and trigger the post update
      - if the loc is *not* too old, but the posts are, trigger a post update.


more precisely:
     - when we first start, show the location spinner. 
     - use the last-known-location method to start populating the display
       - if it's available, set the current location to that, trigger the posts update, and keep running the location update in the bkgnd
       - if it's unavailable, just keep spinning and looking for location
     - during an update, as new locations keep coming in, stop 30s after we get something with error <= than grid radius
       - at that point, if we have no location, save it and trigger
         post lookup. otherwise, save it and notify the user that they've moved if they've moved > grid radius.
       


start a timer, check for new posts continuously via long-polling (while the activity is open). onResume: start this poll. onPause: stop it.

possibly launchMode=singleTask

if there's data/location available, just show it.

v 1.0: we don't store it across destruction, so if it's destroyed, we refetch.)
v 1.1: shove the latest data into a cache. keep at most a few hundred thumbs & posts. only current loc.

When there's no location known:
     main view: contains nothing (preparing...)

     show (spinner) looking for location...

If we can't find location with accuracy <= blur radius within 30s, say
we can't get a fix, show retry button.

[Turn on wifi.] -> make sure to remove this after on

     (spinner) loading posts...

     if load fails: error message and retry button (no service?)


On "location found":
   - if nothing displayed: looking-for-loc spinner, commence loading posts
   - if something displayed: show "location changed. get new posts?"

On "posts loaded":
   - if nothing displayed: show posts
   - if _something_ displayed: say "new posts; click to display" 
     	-> display them.

	   right now, we refetch everything and cap by # of posts, so
	   if you're in Chelsea and walk to SoHo, you'll still see
	   those SoHo posts (but with updated location info) until
	   they decay. For now, we'll rely on the server to calculate
	   reldist. (might not be safe to push onto unit). and
	   reltime. v1.1: push some of this to the client, since it
	   has a better idea of its location. specifically, update the
	   relative times every minute and onResume() and the relative
	   locations whenever we change location, even if the user
	   doesn't accept it..


squarechan 	   [reload] [relocate] [new] <- FIXED
[optional: getting location...]
	   [wifi is off: turn on for better location peformance] <- show when wifi off and above label shown, check if wifi on during onResume; hide if it is.
[optional: getting new posts...]

main screen: centered [spinner] loading...
OR:

listview of posts - scrolling

A post:

[pic] text text text
      /xx meters away - yy min ago/ italic

[spacer] [pic] reply reply      
	       /xx meters away - yy min ago/ italics

[spacer] [nopic] reply reply  [truncated at 250 chars, click to expand <- do that]
	       /xx meters away - yy min ago/ italics
	       
     xyz replies omitted - show all - reply 

repeat for N posts, old posts fall off the bottom. 
arraycontentprovider?

click a thumbnail: 
      v 1.0: open the full view in the browser. 
      v 1.1: open the full view in our app, provide a link to the browser if the user wants to download it.



On go to bottom: load more old posts when we scroll all the way down. show spinner. don't do this when >500 shown. drop old ones as new ones come in.

MENU: about-> out website
prefs-> set the default blur radius and loc check ivl.

API issues:
- supply absolute times, not relative, since the app needs to update them.

N: new post/reply

show the fixed header without the new post button

If called with reply, say "Replying to post #xxx - "First 30 chars..." [if available]

Text box: full width, two lines, onchange/onblur/onkeydown: checkValidity

If it's an OP, "photo required for new post". if none attached "Please attach a photo." in bold

Attach pic: gallery | camera

if pic picked: show spinner while prepping thumb. do not activate post
button until this is finished (e.g., onvalidate only works once we
have the resized, downsampled ready & thumb shown). 

Cancel post (confirm w/modal dialog) | post (upload, block until
successful, return on failure.) on success, send message to main
screen to pull in this (& other new posts). & force update? v1.1:
always force update if small # of new posts & nothing pushed off the
bottom.

cancel thumb by clicking cancel button. 

on post: modal dialog w/cancel btn. (back btn same as cancel button)
   fail: Failed to post. $Error. go bck.  success: clean form, pop
   this stack frame, send meage to application that this thread (if
   reply, reply page, if not, this page) should be reloaded
   immediately.
